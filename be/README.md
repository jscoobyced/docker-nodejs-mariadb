# NodeJS Back-End with Typescript

The easiest way to get started is to run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
from the root folder of this project. This will start the development environment for both Front-End and Back-End, hot-reload enabled.

Any change made in Front-End and Back-End will be instantly reflected.
