# React Front-End with Typescript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The easiest way to get started is to run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
from the root folder of this project. This will start the development environment for both Front-ENd and Back-ENd, hot-reload enabled.
